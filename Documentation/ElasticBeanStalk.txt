Abbreviation Key:
-AWS = Amazon Web Services
-EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud
    *Is a raw virtual machine in the cloud to host our site, provided by AWS
-EB = elastic beanstalk
    *This is the AWS service which automates EC2 (elastic cloud compute) management.
    *Auto scales EC2 instances for traffic needs.
-IAM = Identity and Access Management
    *Defines users and their roles in the AWS environment. I have one account setup for myself with admin access, and the parent account is the AWS account under my email. Anyone can create a user and we can assign it admin permissions if someone else needs to work with AWS stuff. Let tyler know if you need this.

I. EB SETUP:
{
command used to init EB setup:
eb init -p python-3.11 app-name
ex) eb init -p python-3.11 Capstone-4970
(can also use "eb init --interactive" don't use codecommit if prompted)
^This is good if it's making your server us-west-2 or something you dont want. We are using us-east-1.

app-name will be Capstone-4970

IAM user: tyler
IAM password: Csci4970

aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: ask tyler for this
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ask tyler for this
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json

keypair name: aws-eb
keypair passphrase: [empty]
}

II. TO TAKE EVERYTHING OFFLINE AND AVOID USAGE CHARGES:
{
1. go to project folder and then back-end directory
    cd "I:\Alternate Desktop\School\CSCI4970\CSCI4970-Capstone\CSCI4970-Capsoft-Solutions-Project\Back-end"
    cd "<project directory>\CSCI4970-Capsoft-Solutions-Project\BackEnd"
2. terminate instance
    eb terminate dev-env
}

PUT EVERTYHING BACK ONLINE:
{
1. recreate instance
    eb create dev-env
2. deploy instance
    eb deploy
3. open it in browser
    eb open
}

BETTER METHOD OF TAKING EVERYTHING OFFLINE WITHOUT TERMINATING THE INSTANCES:
{
1. Set the scale of EC2 servers to zero.
    eb scale 0
2. Can bring back website by putting scale back and redeploying
    eb scale 1
    eb deploy
}

TO MAKE CHANGES FROM VSCODE TO THE WEBSITE
{
1. Commit and push
2. In Windows Powershell go/cd to proj path/Back-end
3. eb deploy
}
