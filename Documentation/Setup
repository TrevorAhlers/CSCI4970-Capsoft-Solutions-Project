create virtual environment for python when you first clone project:
python -m venv .venv

activate the virtual environment (notice your terminal is now using the venv)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

then install libraries:
pip install flask

(then type deactivate to get out of the venv)

MAKE SURE YOUR IDE IS USING THE .VENV as the environment and not your computer global python environment!

This means you will be using libraries in the local venv folder and you dont need to install flask on your system for example.

Achieve this in VSCode by using the hotkey: "cntrl + shift+ P" and searching at the top: "Python: Select Interpreter" ... you'll see a recommended path, and your global path, but we want to select "Enter interpreter path". You know the path to enter by looking at the left pane Project Explorer, right-clicking the .venv and copy relative path. Paste that into the top bar and should you be good to go.

run the program
python .\Back-end\application.py
