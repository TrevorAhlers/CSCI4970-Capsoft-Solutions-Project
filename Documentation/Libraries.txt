Python:

1. flask
    -Routes requests with the following request types:
        GET: Retrieve information.
        POST: Send new data to the server.
        PUT: Update a resource completely.
        PATCH: Update a resource partially.
        DELETE: Remove a resource.
        OPTIONS: Discover what methods are supported.
        HEAD: Like GET but returns headers only, without the body.
    -Interfaces well with Angular
    -Uses HTML templates

2. gunicorn
    -Allows concurrent processes... better production readiness.

3. flask_jwt_extended
    -JWT = JSON Web Tokens
    -Manages authentication, session management, user privilege to certain pages/information.
