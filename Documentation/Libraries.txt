Python:

1. flask
    -Routes requests with the following request types:
        GET: Retrieve information.
        POST: Send new data to the server.
        PUT: Update a resource completely.
        PATCH: Update a resource partially.
        DELETE: Remove a resource.
        OPTIONS: Discover what methods are supported.
        HEAD: Like GET but returns headers only, without the body.
    -Interfaces well with Angular
    -Uses HTML templates

2. gunicorn
    -Allows concurrent processes... better production readiness.

3. flask_jwt_extended
    -JWT = JSON Web Tokens
    -Manages authentication, session management, user privilege to certain pages/information.
    -docs: https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic_usage.html

4. pandas
    -Data analysis, data manipulation.
    -CSV navigation

5. flask-cors
    -Flask-CORS is a lightweight extension for Flask that automatically adds necessary HTTP headers
    -Lets our app accept requests from different domains.
    -This is really useful when your Angular front end and Flask back end run on separate servers or ports,
    preventing cross-origin errors without extra hassle.
