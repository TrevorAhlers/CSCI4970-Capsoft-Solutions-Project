--------------------------------------
create virtual environment for python when you first clone project:
--------------------------------------
    python -m venv .venv

--------------------------------------
activate the virtual environment (notice your terminal is now using the venv)
--------------------------------------
    1. cd BackEnd
    2. .\.venv\Scripts\activate

    then install libraries:
    pip install flask
    pip install pandas

    (then type deactivate to get out of the venv)

--------------------------------------
MAKE SURE YOUR IDE IS USING THE .VENV as the environment and not your computer global python environment!
--------------------------------------
    This means you will be using libraries in the local venv folder and you dont need to install flask on your system for example.

    Achieve this in VSCode by using the hotkey: "cntrl + shift+ P" and searching at the top: "Python: Select Interpreter" ... you'll see a recommended path, and your global path, but we want to select "Enter interpreter path". You know the path to enter by looking at the left pane Project Explorer, right-clicking the .venv and copy relative path. Paste that into the top bar and should you be good to go.

--------------------------------------
Launch the site locally
--------------------------------------
    python .\BackEnd\application.py


--------------------------------------
Running the py files:
--------------------------------------
    *Many of the py modules import other modules to function. Trying to simply run a module like csv_parser.py in the IDE will not work. It can't see the other files it needs to import to function.

    Here's how to run files in our project:

    MAIN APP) Run the main application with the following command (when in the main project directory):
        python .\BackEnd\application.py
        *Note the .venv is not activated.

    MODULES) To run modules like csv_parser.py, you need to run the program through virtual environment.
        (If your module doesn't import other modules from our project then you can run it in the IDE and don't need to do this)
        1. cd BackEnd
        2. .venv\Scripts\activate
        3. python -m Utils.csv_parser
        (remember you can deactivate the .venv after you're done, if you want to go back to your normal terminal use command: deactivate)
