Attribute Analysis

Below is a breakdown of the Fall2022 CSV file recieved from our sponsor. Columns are a "candidate" to be included in the Class object, not necessarily by utility, but if they contain information that isn't redundant. We don't want to eliminate any dimension of scheduled classes that might useful later.
