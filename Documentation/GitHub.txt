*see what branch youre using
git branch

*if you need to switch from main to dev, for example:
git checkout dev

*if you need to update your local project with the latest on github... lets say the dev branch (be careful you arent saving over changes you want to keep locally)
git fetch origin
git pull origin dev

*if you need to make your own branch (and switch to it)
git checkout -b new-branch-name

*add and commit some changes to your active branch
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

*push a commit
git push origin branch-name

*you have a branch that you want to use to update the dev branch... but you dont want to lose your current branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git merge dev-tyler
git push origin dev
git checkout dev-tyler <--- switch back to dev-tyler
git pull origin dev <--- Sync dev-tyler with the latest dev update (if someone pushed after your merge... which is unlikely but possible)
