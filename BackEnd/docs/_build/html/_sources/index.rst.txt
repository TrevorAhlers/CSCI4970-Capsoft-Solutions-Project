Scheduler App documentation
===========================

The Scheduler App is designed to automatically assign classrooms to course sections based on input data. It processes scheduling constraints, including time conflicts and room availability, to optimize classroom assignments.

Features:

* Detects and reports scheduling conflicts.
* Supports multiple time slots and overlapping schedules.


This app helps academic institutions efficiently manage room assignments and avoid conflicts in course scheduling.
