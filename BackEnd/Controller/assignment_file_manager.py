# Assignment File Manager:

# Manages section and classroom objects in an AssignmentFile model

from flask import session

#TODO: When we want to save, we use this module to populate an AssignmentFile model with current sections and classrooms -> Store model in DB under a name (default name is some timestamp)

#TODO: Delete a file model from the DB

#TODO: export a file to CSV and return to frontend? should that be its own module?
